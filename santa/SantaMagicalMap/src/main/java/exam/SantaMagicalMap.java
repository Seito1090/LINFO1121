/**
 * Santa Claus is streamlining his delivery routes with a magical map.
 * This year, the Elves' initial calculations for the distances between houses are a bit off, failing to respect the triangle inequality,
 * which states that the direct path between two points should not be longer than any indirect path.
 * However, Santa also wants to ensure that the new distances do not imply a shorter path than originally calculated,
 * keeping the realism of actual travel distances.
 *
 * Santa needs this map adjusted to balance efficiency and realism.
 * Your task is to modify the magical map so that it adheres to the triangle inequality
 * while ensuring that no direct path becomes shorter than in the original map.
 * In other terms it means that for all pairs (i, j) the value
 * the cost i->j must be the shortest path between i and j in the original map.
